A completely print-ready version of [Scott Alexander's amazing book, "Unsong."](http://unsongbook.com/)

The [source PDF](https://simplegifs.com/stuff/unsong.pdf) is by u/pachyderminator on Reddit. I took their idea of the cover design and improved and expanded on it.

The files in `/final` are the inside body and the cover spread. Both have been preflight-checked by Acrobat Pro and can be submitted as-is to an on-demand printer such as Lulu.
