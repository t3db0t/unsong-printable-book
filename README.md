A completely print-ready version of [Scott Alexander's amazing book, "Unsong."](http://unsongbook.com/)

The [source PDF](https://simplegifs.com/stuff/unsong.pdf) is by u/pachyderminator on Reddit. I took their idea of the cover design and improved and expanded on it.

The files in `/final` are the inside body and the cover spread. Both have been preflight-checked by Acrobat Pro and can be submitted as-is to an on-demand printer such as Lulu.

The page format is US Trade (6 x 9 in / 152 x 229 mm) and weighs in at an impressive 708 pages.

# Known Issues

- The outside side and bottom margins are unnecessarily large, but it doesn't negatively impact anything. The original content pdf would have to be re-rendered but I don't have the source for that. It's a matter of opinion really.
